## Problem 1: Regression - A predictive n-dimensional data point model

Description: Load a nD x1, x2, ... xn, y datapoint set that is roughly quadratic and have the model generate y
values given an xi coord.

Variants:

* 2 points should produce a simple linear essentially perfect model
* a scatter of many points with linear model should fit the best line
* 3 points to define a quadratic with 2nd order model
* Use this simple case as a way to understand standard Keras layers
* Write a custom Keras layer, possibly a finite element solver

## Problem: CNN - Image Classification by Category / Keyword Using Convolution (CNN)

Train: Associate text descriptions with 2D images
Output: 2D bitmaps that fit a query. The model assembles images
wherein keywords in the query are matched to

## Problem: User Feedback Gister

Use Case: I want users to be able to enter free-text rants without annoying rigid question surveys.
I then want to ask the question, "What are the common sentiments (gists)."

Training Data: TensorFlow datasets Amazon or Yelp

## Problem : Local Document knowledge store

A model takes in a bunch of general information in the form of source and word documents, emails.
The model can then 'search' for concepts, present them by data, author,
source document.

Provide a timeline of documents on a given subject.

For example, a set of state laws and regulations.

## Problem: App or Music Suggester
Instead of a simple statistical model in which the applications are just the most commonly used, this will factor in day
of the week time of day animal favor, recent history over older history

- Time of day
- Location GPS
- Day of week

## Problem : Voice and Music generator
