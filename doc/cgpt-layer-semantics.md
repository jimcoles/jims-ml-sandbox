To find a summarized form of the mathematical operations performed by different layer types in Keras, you can refer to the [Keras Layer Documentation](https://keras.io/api/layers/) or other online tutorials that break down important layer classes mathematically.
However, hereâ€™s a **simple summary table** based on Keras's official operation descriptions for **common layer types** (including dense, convolutional, recurrent, etc.):
( (batch_size, units) )( y[i, j] = f\left(\sum_{k,l} W[k, l] \cdot x[i+k, j+l] + b\right) )( y = \max(0, x) )( (batch_size, units) )( (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim) )

| **Layer Class** | **Mathematical Operation** | **Output Shape** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dense** | ( y = f(Wx + b) ), where ( f ) = activation function, ( W ) = weights matrix, ( b ) = bias vector | Learn linear & non-linear relationships using weights & biases. Often the core layer for fully-connected models. |
| **Conv1D / Conv2D** | Depends on strides, padding, filters | Extract spatial features using sliding windows across input data. |
| **Flatten** | No mathematical operation. Reshapes input data to ((batch_size, \text{flattened size})). | ( (batch_size,) )flattened size | Converts data between dimensions for dense layers. |
| **Dropout** | Randomly sets a fraction ( rate ) of input units to zero during training. | Same as input shape | Prevent overfitting by ignoring certain features temporarily. |
| **BatchNormalization** | ( y = \gamma \cdot \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta ), where ( \mu ), ( \sigma ): mean & variance; ( \gamma, \beta ): learned parameters | Same as input shape | Normalize inputs to improve convergence and stability. |
| **ReLU Activation** | Same as input shape | Introduce non-linearity by zeroing out negative values. |
| **LSTM (Recurrent)** | Combines forget, input, and output gating logic in a sequence-to-sequence operation ((h_t, c_t)) using input weights ((W_x)) and recurrent weights ((W_h)). | ( (batch_size, units) )or full sequence shape | Learn temporal correlations and patterns in sequential data (e.g., time series, text). |
| **GRU (Recurrent)** | Uses simplified gating compared to LSTM for updating internal states ((h_t)). | Faster alternative to LSTMs for sequential data. |
| **MaxPooling** | Outputs maximum value from fixed-size sliding window on the input. | Depends on pool size, strides, and padding | Down-sample feature maps for computational efficiency and feature abstraction. |
| **AveragePooling** | Outputs average value from sliding window on the input. | Depends on pool size, strides, and padding | Similar to MaxPooling but uses averaging instead of maximum. |
| **Embedding** | Learns a dense vector representation of input indices (e.g., for words or categories). | Transforms categorical data into dense vector space used for sequential tasks or modeling words' relationships. |
