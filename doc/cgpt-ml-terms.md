## **Types of Error Measurements (Loss Functions)**

#### **A**
- Absolute Error (MAE) - Mean Absolute Error MAE[ = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \hat{y}_i| ] Semantics: Measures the average absolute difference between true values (( y )) and predicted values (( \hat{y} )). It treats all errors equally (linear scale). Use Case: Regression tasks where outliers are less influential.

#### **B**
- Binary Crossentropy (Log Loss) Loss[ = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right] ] Semantics: Measures the discrepancy between the predicted probability (( \hat{y}_i )) and the actual binary label (( y_i )). Penalizes predictions far from the true value more heavily. Use Case: Binary classification problems (e.g., spam detection, yes/no tasks).

#### **C**
- Categorical Crossentropy Loss[ = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^k y_{i,j} \log(\hat{y}{i,j}) ] Semantics: Measures the distance between the true probability distribution ( y{i,j} ) (one-hot encoded) and the predicted probability distribution ( \hat{y}_{i,j} ). Assigns higher penalties for incorrect predictions in multi-class setups. Use Case: Multi-class classification problems (e.g., hand-written digit recognition with MNIST dataset).
- Cosine Similarity Loss Loss[ = 1 - \frac{\text{dot}(y, \hat{y})}{|y| |\hat{y}|} ] Semantics: Calculates the similarity between two vectors, penalizing dissimilar directions. Values range from 0 (similar) to 1 (opposite directions). Use Case: Text similarity, information retrieval, or other tasks based on embeddings.

#### **H**
- **Huber Loss**
  [ L(y, \hat{y}) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2}(y - \hat{y})^2 & \text{for } |y - \hat{y}| \leq \delta \ \delta \cdot |y - \hat{y}| - \frac{1}{2} \delta^2 & \text{for } |y - \hat{y}| > \delta \end{cases} ]
  **Semantics**: Combines the robustness of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for large errors and the sensitivity of Mean Squared Error (MSE) for small errors.
  **Use Case**: Regression tasks where you want to handle outliers moderately.

#### **K**
- KL Divergence (Kullback-Leibler Divergence) KL[ (P | Q) = \sum_{i} P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)} ] Semantics: Measures the difference between two probability distributions ( P ) (true) and ( Q ) (predicted). Penalizes predictions that place most weight on unlikely classes. Use Case: Probabilistic models, including autoencoders or generative models.

#### **L**
- Log-Cosh Loss [ L(y, \hat{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log(\cosh(\hat{y}_i - y_i)) ] Semantics: A smooth alternative to Mean Absolute Error (MAE), penalizing large errors less severely while being differentiable everywhere. Use Case: Regression tasks requiring less sensitivity to large individual errors.

#### **M**
- MSE - Mean Squared Error MSE[ = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 ] Semantics: Measures the average squared difference between predicted values and actual values. Penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones (quadratic scale). Use Case: Standard loss function for regression tasks where small errors are desirable (e.g., predicting house prices).
- MSLE - Mean Squared Logarithmic Error MSLE[ = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \log(1 + y_i) - \log(1 + \hat{y}_i) \right)^2 ] Semantics: Calculates the squared log differences between predicted and true values, focusing on relative rather than absolute errors. Use Case: Tasks requiring penalization of large errors when targets are highly scaled (e.g., predicting population, ranking).

#### **P**
- Poisson Loss Loss[ = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \hat{y}_i - y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) \right) ] Semantics: Derived from the Poisson distribution, this loss measures how well the predicted values match the true count data. Use Case: Count-based predictions (e.g., number of visitors to a public event).

#### **S**
- **Sparse Categorical Crossentropy**
  Same as categorical crossentropy but works directly with integer labels (not one-hot encoded).
  **Semantics**: Measures the divergence between true labels and predicted probabilities for multi-class classification without needing one-hot encoding.
  **Use Case**: Multi-class tasks with large output space (e.g., language translation).
- Squared Hinge Loss Loss[ = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \max(1 - y_i\hat{y}_i, 0)^2 ] Semantics: Hinge loss penalizes predictions incorrect by an active margin (e.g., when ( y_i\hat{y}_i ) is less than 1). The squared variant strengthens penalization of incorrect classifications. Use Case: Binary or multi-class classification using support vector machines (SVM).

### Notes for Selection in Keras:
Keras provides these loss functions through easy-to-use classes or strings. For example:
- **`loss='mse'`** or **`loss=tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()`**
- **`loss='binary_crossentropy'`** or **`loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()`**

### Which to Choose:
- Regression: Use **MSE**, **MAE**, **Huber Loss**, or **Log-Cosh Loss** based on whether you prioritize sensitivity to outliers or smoothness.
- Binary Classification: Use **Binary Crossentropy**.
- Multi-Class Classification: Use **Categorical Crossentropy** or **Sparse Categorical Crossentropy**.
- Probabilistic Models: Use **KL Divergence** or **Poisson Loss**.
- Embedding Similarity: Use **Cosine Similarity Loss**.
